# Roadmap

## Week 1
- Setup core project structure (frontend, backend, database).
- Implement basic user registration and login forms (no email verification).
- Create a user profile page to display basic info.
- Develop a simple page for resume upload (PDF/DOCX) and storage on the server.
- Create a text area for Job Description (JD) input.
- Implement a very basic "AI" analysis: simple keyword extraction from resume and JD.
- Display a rudimentary "fit score" based on direct keyword overlap.
- Show basic "keywords to add" suggestions.
- Build a minimalistic dashboard to view the last analysis result.
- Deploy a clickable demo to a staging environment.

## Weeks 2-4
- **User Authentication & Profile**:
    - Implement secure password hashing and session management.
    - Add email verification for user registration.
    - Allow users to update profile information (name, email).
    - Implement password reset functionality.
- **Resume Management (Upload, Storage, Parsing)**:
    - Enhance resume upload: client-side validation, secure cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
    - Develop robust text extraction from PDF/DOCX using a dedicated library (e.g., `python-docx`, `pdfminer.six`).
    - Store parsed text content alongside original file metadata in the database.
- **Job Description Management**:
    - Allow users to save multiple JDs to their profile.
    - Implement basic JD editing and deletion functionalities.
- **AI Analysis Engine (Skill Gap, Fit Score, Suggestions)**:
    - **Skill Gap Analysis**:
        - Refine keyword extraction from both resume and JD using more sophisticated NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for tokenization, lemmatization.
        - Develop a skill categorization/matching logic beyond exact keyword match.
        - *ML Note*: Initial rule-based NLP for tokenization, lemmatization, and basic entity/skill extraction.
    - **Resume-Job Fit Score**:
        - Implement a scoring algorithm incorporating weighted keyword matches, skill relevance, and experience indicators.
        - *ML Note*: Develop a scoring model, possibly using TF-IDF or similar vectorization for more nuanced matching of skills.
    - **Tailoring Suggestions**:
        - Generate more intelligent suggestions for keywords/phrases to add/emphasize based on identified skill gaps and JD requirements.
        - Prioritize suggestions based on their potential impact on the fit score.
        - *ML Note*: Leverage keyword importance (e.g., IDF) to suggest impactful terms and phrases.
- **Reporting & Dashboard**:
    - Design and build a comprehensive dashboard displaying all past analyses.
    - Show detailed analysis results for each entry: breakdown of skill match, missing skills, suggested additions.
    - Implement basic filtering and sorting of analysis history.
- **Subscription & Payment Gateway**:
    - Integrate with a basic payment provider (e.g., Stripe Checkout) for a single premium tier.
    - Implement logic to differentiate between free and premium features (e.g., limited number of analyses for free users).
- **Notification System**:
    - Implement basic in-app notifications (e.g., "Analysis Complete," "Subscription Expiring").

## Month 2-3
- **Infrastructure & Stability**:
    - Set up production-grade hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure) with load balancing.
    - Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployments.
    - Configure robust logging, monitoring, and error tracking (e.g., Sentry, Prometheus/Grafana).
    - Implement automated database backups and recovery procedures.
    - Optimize database queries and introduce caching for frequently accessed data.
    - Ensure scalability for AI analysis engine (e.g., message queues for asynchronous processing jobs).
- **Security Hardening**:
    - Conduct security audits for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
    - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users.
    - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (SSL/TLS).
    - Enhance access control and role-based permissions.
- **Polishing & User Experience (UX)**:
    - Refine UI/UX for a seamless and intuitive user journey across all features.
    - Improve error messages and provide helpful user feedback.
    - Optimize page load times and responsiveness across devices.
    - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with target users.
- **Analytics & Feedback**:
    - Integrate analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to track user engagement, feature usage, and conversion funnels.
    - Implement an in-app feedback mechanism.
- **Subscription & Payment Gateway**:
    - Implement full subscription lifecycle management (upgrades, downgrades, cancellations).
    - Set up invoicing and billing history for users.
- **Marketing & SEO**:
    - Prepare marketing landing pages describing features and benefits.
    - Implement basic SEO best practices for discoverability.
